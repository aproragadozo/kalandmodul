## Introduction
This is a practical introduction to [the setting outlined in my blog](https://budapest-urban-fantasy.blogspot.com/).
As such, it is a one-shot with possible lead-ins to a larger campaign.
### Design Considerations
* PC pregens that illustrate typical "mage career paths" in the setting.
* Emblematic location.
* Conflict and resolution touching on central themes of the setting.
A group of misfits and outcasts in an authoritarian post-cyberpunk urban fantasy setting attempt to sabotage a government-run secret laboratory to stop the  horrendous experiments allegedly run there. They make an uncomfortable discovery, and must scramble to escape with their lives.

## How to Use This Adventure
Each pregenerated PC has their unique connection to the plot
The pregens are intentionally overloaded with setting detail - the idea is to offer material for future games with the same characters as PCs or NPCs.
Pregens have a *menu* of aspects and options to build from.
