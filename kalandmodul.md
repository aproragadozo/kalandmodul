## Context
This is a practical introduction to the setting writtem on the blog.

## Design Considerations
* PC pregens that illustrate typical "mage career paths" in the setting.
* Emblematic location.
* Conflict and resolution touching on central themes of the setting.

## How to Use This Adventure
Each pregenerated PC has their unique connection to the plot
The pregens are intentionally overloaded with setting detail - the idea is to offer material for future games with the same characters as PCs or NPCs.
Pregens have a *menu* of aspects and options to build from.
2 ways of how the disparate characters fit into the group

### Setup
outsiders, looked-down-upon subversives, idealists
followers of a secret and illegal cult
#### What do the PCs want?
#### What do the bad guys want?
#### What happens if the PCs don't do anything?

## Structure
The adventure is a 5-room dungeon variation with guardian, puzzle, setback, boss, fight, and reward phases.

## Prequel

## Guardian
|Motivation |Location |NPC |Information Learned |Treasure |
|:----------|:--------|:---|:-------------------|:--------|
|Only project internals, or at least technocratic paradigm willworkers are allowed in.|A threshold between worlds: a pretty mundane-looking entrance and elevator bank to an underground parking lot. With a paradigm-scanner that looks like a walk-in MRI scanner with an old-fashioned and clunky look.|A set of two robotic pre-recorded messages: one for allowing, one for refusing entry.|Entry badges for non-project visitors are valid only for half an hour, after which security will find and escort badge-wearers off the premises.|A proper permanent badge might be acquired from a project member who just happens to be returning from their lunch break?|
